<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Students, researchers, faculty, and staff&amp;nbsp;celebrated graduating seniors, departmental award winners,&amp;nbsp;and the end of the academic year&amp;nbsp;at the recent Senior Celebration and Awards Banquet of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering&amp;nbsp;(CEE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In CEE, we are constantly striving to create new and innovative solutions, and to find ways to improve the world through our research,” CEE department head and Jerry McAfee Professor of Engineering Markus Buehler said at the May 18 gathering. “We are able to have such a large impact because of the dedication of community members to our department mission and vision, and to MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening hour showcased senior capstone projects from members of the Class of 2017, including research on topics ranging from&amp;nbsp;vehicle emissions to&amp;nbsp;the Mosul Dam in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The capstones showed the potential of using the world as a classroom,” said Esther and Harold E. Edgerton Career Development Professor Admir Masic. “Many of the projects were connected to CEE fieldwork experiences — like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2017/getting-hands-dirty-students-experience-fieldwork-hawaii-trex-0217&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;TREX&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2016/seeking-inspiration-ancient-technologies-0406&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;ONE-MA3&lt;/a&gt; — and I think that’s an important direction to follow. By bringing our students around the world and helping them connect their research to real-world challenges, the students are able to have a direct impact. We saw the results of this concept in several of the capstone presentations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the banquet, faculty members&amp;nbsp;were invited to vote for the winners of the Capstone Poster Prize, which was ultimately awarded to two teams studying&amp;nbsp;vehicle emissions in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The winners were seniors Rebecca Sugrue, Kali Rosendo, Tiffany Wang, Elaine Cunha, Kathy Dieppa, Ru Mehendalem,&amp;nbsp;and Erin Reynolds. Rosendo, Sugrue, and Wang measured roadside emissions and calculated emission factors from cars. Cunha, Dieppa, Mehendale, and Reynolds created a model to quantify vehicle emissions from cars in Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When we won it was just a lot of excitement. We worked really hard, and I think on the inside everyone wanted to win a little bit, but to have it happen and to have Professor [Jesse] Kroll also be recognized was awesome,” Sugrue said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event was also the community debut of a newly-formed CEE band, featuring graduate students Justin Montgomery, Kelsey Wittels, and Dustin Weigl;&amp;nbsp;postdocs Stefan Thiele, Ruud Janssen, and Diego Lopez;&amp;nbsp;and visiting scholar Balazs Lengyel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As the night went on people started getting into the show and they were singing along, cheering, and just generally rocking out,” Montgomery said. “The band had been hyped&amp;nbsp;a bit leading up to this,&amp;nbsp;so many people were excited to finally get to hear what we had been practicing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The band, who call themselves Hell’s Beavers, performed intermittently throughout the night and played a variety of styles, from classic rock to reggae. The inclusive group is one of a number of CEE-sponsored initiatives to build a stronger community across the department, and injected an extra boost of fun to the celebration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think we were all pretty excited to have the opportunity to play for friends and colleagues in the department who otherwise would never see this side of us,” Montgomery said. “It was great to be able to show them something that we are passionate about and work hard at outside of our research and coursework.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recognizing outstanding members of the CEE community &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year, students, researchers, faculty, and staff are encouraged to nominate their peers for &lt;a href=&quot;https://cee.mit.edu/cee-awards/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CEE Awards&lt;/a&gt;. As the academic year concludes, the community honors the winners and celebrates their accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The awards portion of the night kicked off by honoring undergraduates. The CEE Best Undergraduate Research Award was given to seniors Elaine Cunha and Tess Hegarty. Cunha was commended for her dedication to research, specifically her work on a collaborative project with Massachusetts General Hospital. Hegarty was honored for her original research into the embodied carbon of structures, which was conducted as part of a two-year Undergraduate Research Opportunity (UROP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junior Jillian Dressler received the CEE Leadership and Community Award for her hard work and dedication to CEE. She was recognized for her enthusiasm for the department, particularly through her role as social chair for the Civil and Environmental Engineering Student Association (CEESA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Juan Hermosilla (1957) Prize, given to a student demonstrating exceptional talent and potential for future contributions at the intersection of mechanics, materials, structures and design, was awarded to senior George Varnavides. For his senior capstone project, Varnavides worked on a project about the Mosul Dam in Iraq. His project was inspired by a &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; article on the dam, which was constructed under Saddam Hussein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Leo (Class of 1924) and Mary Grossman Award, which is given annually to an undergraduate student with a strong interest in transportation and a strong academic record, was presented to sophomore Mark Mockett. Mockett was commended for his dedication and thorough research during a UROP in which he worked on a market selection project for the East Japan Railway Company and a market project on a high-speed rail link between Los Angeles and Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senior Rebecca Sugrue was awarded the Paul L. Busch (1958) Prize, an award for an undergraduate student in environmental science and engineering for academic achievement and contributions to the CEE community. Sugrue has been involved with many facets of CEE, from serving as faculty liaison in CEESA to participating in freshmen pre-orientation programs and being active on the Undergraduate Association’s Committee on Sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senior Bryan Lilley was the recipient of the Tucker-Voss Award, presented to an undergraduate or graduate student who shows particular promise in the field of building construction. For his senior capstone project, Lilley worked with Masic on how to minimize carbon footprint with different materials. The award was created in the 1950s, when the Department of Building Construction merged with the Department of Civil Engineering. The award is named in memory of Professor Ross F. Tucker and Professor Walter C. Voss, who were the first two heads of the Department of Building Construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of graduate students were also recognized for their various contributions to the department during the year and throughout their time at MIT. Qingjun “Judy” Yang was awarded the Trond Kaalstad (Class of 1957) Fellowship, awarded annually to a graduate student who has displayed leadership and contributed significantly to the well-being of the CEE community. Yang was recognized for being a founding member of MIT Talks on Reliable Environmental Science (TREES), a student organization that aims to make environmental science more accessible to all audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Maseeh Annual Award for Excellence as a Teaching Assistant was awarded to Xiaojing “Ruby” Fu, a graduate student and highly-rated teaching assistant for 1.000 (Computer Programming for Engineering Applications). Fu is also Chair of the Henry L. Pierce Laboratory Social Committee and an active participant in community events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third graduate student award was given to Anna Tarakanova, who was given the CEE Best Doctoral Thesis Award. The award honors scholarly and academic excellence and a high level of distinction of a CEE graduate student, and it was given&amp;nbsp;for her thesis, “Molecular structure, hierarchical assembly and stimuli — responsive mechanics of tropoelastin and elastin biomaterials.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stefan Thiele, a postdoc in Professor Martin Polz’s lab, received the CEE Postdoctoral Scholar Mentoring, Teaching, and Excellence Award. The award is given in recognition of mentoring, teaching, and other exceptional contributions by a postdoc. In addition to volunteering as a mentor for the mini-UROP program for freshmen, Thiele has worked tirelessly to ensure the department engages in the most environmentally sustainable options and introduced an initiative to reuse&amp;nbsp;bowls and utensils to reduce waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students, researchers, faculty, and staff were also given the opportunity to nominate faculty members for a number of awards. Gilbert W. Winslow Career Development Professor Pedro Reis was awarded the Maseeh Excellence in Teaching Award, presented annually to the most outstanding faculty instructor in the past year. Reis was acknowledged for his energetic teaching style, as well as his willingness to engage with students outside of the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CEE Distinguished Service and Leadership Award was given to JR East Professor of Engineering Joseph Sussman. The award recognizes outstanding departmental service and leadership contributions of a member of the CEE faculty, to acknowledge an individual who fosters a culture of diversity, inclusiveness, and innovation, to further the department mission and vision and MIT as a whole. Sussman was honored for his friendship and mentorship to both students and fellow faculty members and for his support of all CEE community events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With so many excellent colleagues in implicit competition for this award, I am humbled and honored to be selected,” said Sussman, who was unable to attend the event. “I look forward to receiving the certificate which I will display with pride.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Class of 1942 Professor of Architecture and CEE Professor John Ochsendorf was awarded the Samuel M. Seegal Prize, for his engagement with and dedication to his students. The prize alternates annually between CEE and the Sloan School of Management, and is given to a professor who inspires students to pursue and achieve excellence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ole Madsen Mentoring Award, a new award for 2017, was given to associate professor of CEE and chemical engineering Jesse Kroll. The award honors a faculty member for his or her contributions to mentoring and educating CEE students outside the classroom, and to inspire them to pursue a career in the field of civil and environmental engineering. Kroll was recognized for his passion for the environment, his willingness to help and mentor students, and to meet with students for faculty dinners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two staff members who have gone above and beyond in their service to the CEE community were awarded the CEE Excellence Award for their excellent contributions to the CEE community, commitment to professionalism, dedication and best practices, as well as fostering a culture of diversity, inclusiveness, and innovation. The awards were presented to Allison Dougherty of CEE Communications and Jackie Foster, an administrative assistant in the Ralph M. Parsons Laboratory for Environmental Science and Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In civil and environmental engineering, there are many hard working students, researchers, faculty and staff that consistently strive to foster a strong community and commitment to excellence among our department and throughout MIT,” Buehler said. “Our annual CEE Awards Ceremony is a chance to recognize these outstanding individuals and thank them for their contributions to the department.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/kerman_arthur.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Arthur K. Kerman&lt;/a&gt;, professor emeritus of physics and a distinguished international researcher in MIT’s Center for Theoretical Physics (CTP) and Laboratory for Nuclear Science, passed away May 11 at the age of 88.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was known for his work on the theory of the structure of nuclei and on the theory of nuclear reactions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He was a wonderful friend and colleague, accomplishing many important things in the creation and promotion of science,” says Professor Emeritus Earle Lomon of the CTP, and Kerman’s longtime friend. “We will greatly miss his friendship and guidance.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Mike Campbell of the University of Rochester poetically says, “The world is a little more empty and quiet without Arthur in it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arthur Kent Kerman was born May 3, 1929, in Montreal. He graduated in 1950 from McGill University, where he studied physics and mathematics. At MIT, under Victor Frederick Weisskopf, he completed his PhD in nuclear surface oscillations in 1953. From 1953 to 1954, he studied with R.F. Christy at Caltech under a National Research Council Postdoctoral Fellowship, and in 1954 he began a two-year stay at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With the presence of Niels Bohr, Aage Bohr, Ben Mottelson, and Willem V.R. Malkus, there were many physicists from Europe and elsewhere, including MIT’s Dave Frisch, making the Institute for Physics an exciting place to be,” recalls Lomon. Kerman’s close friend since the early 1940s, when they were Boy Scouts in Montreal, Lomon studied with Kerman at McGill, MIT, and Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kerman’s research included nuclear and high-energy physics, astrophysics, and the development of advanced particle detectors. His interests in theoretical nuclear physics included nuclear quantum chromodynamics-relativistic heavy-ion physics, nuclear reactions, and laser accelerators. He developed a set of nucleon-nucleon potentials, which were found to be useful for the study of nuclear matter and finite nuclei.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kerman published or co-published more than 100 papers. He wrote papers on the effects of the Coriolis interaction in rotational nuclei; quasi-spin; the application of the Hartree-Fock method to the calculation of the ground state properties of spherical and deformed nuclei; pairing correlations in nuclei; and the possible existence of transuranic islands of stability. In his research on reactions, his papers discussed the scattering of fast particles by nuclei. He also wrote papers on intermediate structure in nuclear reactions; on the properties of isobar analog states; and strangeness analog resonances. He was an early advocate of the importance of quarks for understanding nuclear physics. He developed a nucleon-nucleon potential with a soft core that fits nucleon-nucleon scattering data as well as potentials with a hard repulsive core do, which was found to be useful in the study of what is needed beyond scattering data to determine the properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kerman joined the MIT faculty in 1956 as an assistant professor of physics. In the summers of 1959 and 1960 he was a research associate at the Argonne National Laboratory, and during this period he also was a consultant to the Shell Development Company of Houston, and the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory. He also participated in the Physical Science Study Committee — a group of high school and university physics professors — to write a more accessible and engaging high school physics textbook. He was a consultant with Educational Services Inc. from 1959 to 1966, and collaborated in the quantum physics part of the experimental course Physics: A New Introductory Course (nicknamed PANIC), produced by the Education Research Center at MIT. He became an associate professor in 1960, and the following year, he went on academic leave and was “professeur d’echange” at the University of Paris under a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship. He became professor in 1964.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early 1960s, Kerman traveled with physics professors Sheldon Glashow, then of the University of California at Berkeley and now of Boston University, and Charles Schwartz of Berkeley for a month-long visit as potential members to JASON, a scientific advisory group in Washington, sponsored by the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy, among other government groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were asked at the beginning of our particular interests,” recalls Glashow. “What they were getting at was whether we wanted ‘war’ work or ‘peace’ work. Everybody, except us three ‘lefties’ including Arthur, chose ‘war.’ Our ‘peaceful&#039; challenge was to examine all available sources, whether classified or not, to assess the potential value of airborne or satellite surveillance of the Soviet Union and to produce a supposedly unclassified document. We did our work, and our document was promptly classified. We never heard back from JASON, nor did we care.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 1976-1983, Kerman was the director of MIT’s Center for Theoretical Physics, and from 1983 to 1992, he was director of the Laboratory for Nuclear Science. For many years, Kerman was a leading force in pushing for new initiatives in science. He had various longstanding consulting relationships with Argonne, Brookhaven, Knolls Atomic Power, Lawrence Berkeley, Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos Scientific, and Oak Ridge national laboratories, and with the National Bureau of Standards (now NIST).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kerman &lt;a href=&quot;https://academictree.org/physics/tree.php?pid=125221&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;advised 43 students&lt;/a&gt;, from 1958 to 2006. Kerman officially retired from MIT after 47 years, and retained the title of professor emeritus from 1999 until his passing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He served on many influential bodies, including the Visiting Committees of Bartol Research Foundation, Princeton-Penn Accelerator, the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Inertial Confinement Fusion; National Ignition Facility Programs Review Committee at Livermore; Directorate and Division Review Committees at Livermore; the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider Policy Committee at Brookhaven; Stanford Linear Accelerator Center Scientific Policy Committee; Secretary of Energy Fusion Policy Advisory Committee; the White House Science Council Panel on Science and Technology; the Department of Energy’s Inertial Confinement Fusion Advisory Committee, and the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center Advisory Board. At Los Alamos National Laboratory, he was on the Physics Division Advisory Committee and the Theory Advisory Committee. At Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, he served on the Director’s Advisory Committee, the Physics and Space Technology Advisory Committee, and as chair, the Director’s Review Committee for the Physics Directorate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kerman was made a fellow of the American Physical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the New York Academy of Sciences; he was named a Guggenheim Fellow in Natural Sciences. He was associate editor of &lt;em&gt;Reviews of Modern Physics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many describe Kerman as an outspoken advocate in his field. “He never hesitated, regardless of the consequences, to speak out and to support me when called upon in different circumstances to analyze programs that involved large-scale funding while lacking adequate justification,” says MIT&amp;nbsp; professor of physics Bruno Coppi, Kerman’s friend since the 1960s. “We both had to take a public stand, and time proved that our assessments were correct.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He was, until the end, a valued advisor to different national laboratories and to the highest levels of the Department of Energy,” Coppi adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his presentation, “Three Decades of Interacting with Arthur Kerman,” Michael N. Kreisler, SAIC contractor to the National Nuclear Security Administration at the Department of Energy, and physics professor emeritus at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, had spoken at the 2012 CERN International Conference on Nuclear Reaction Mechanisms about Kerman’s influence on policy within the scientific community: “Arthur either knows everyone of importance or had them as students. I continue to be amazed at his ability to get appointments with everyone in DOE or at the laboratories […] If you want something done, convince Arthur and he’ll be an influential advocate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kreisler added, “Whenever you work on an exciting new science project, Arthur is sure to tell you that he was involved in the very early stages of that project. While it sometimes seems impossible for him to have actually done as much as he says, I know from experience that it really is true.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Kerman was known for his calm, quiet style of leadership. “He had an extraordinary capacity to think on his feet, inspiring collaborators,” says Lomon. “Although, he had much less interest in writing papers, which was a source of some frustration to the same collaborators.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kerman kept frequent contact with his friends and collaborators, despite his declining health. Kerman was coming regularly to weekly physics department lunches. “He delighted in reminiscing about the special atmosphere we had in our department during the times of the ‘Copenhagen Table,’” says Coppi, who met weekly with Kerman, up until a week before his passing away.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After one of his stays in Europe, Kerman had brought back a large table that was kept within the Center for Theoretical Physics. “All active theorists and experimentalists, including Herman Feshbach, Felix Villars, and Martin Deutsch, interested in developments of theory in our department and outside, would gather around it,” Coppi recalls.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I always enjoyed and learned from our lively physics discussions,” recalls Professor John Negele. “His shared interest in high-performance computing and extensive contacts in DOE enabled us to obtain a supercomputer at MIT to study the role of quarks in nuclear physics from first principles.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite health problems in his later years, his commitment to physics and service to the country still saw him traveling all over the world, as well as back to campus, well into his 80s. Until several days before he died at age 88, he was working with Mark Mueller on a new theory of dark matter and energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In recent years Arthur was deeply concerned about the trends in funding and management of research, and of physics in particular, both at the national and international level,” says Coppi. “Arthur will be greatly missed at MIT, in our department, and in the international scientific community.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long-time resident of Winchester, Massachusetts, Kerman was the husband of Enid Ehrlich for 64 years. He was extremely attached to and proud of his children. Eldest son Ben Kerman ’81, who is an MIT biology alumnus and physician at Brigham and Women&#039;s Hospital, lives in Hingham, Massachusetts. Dan is a mechanical engineer at the Federal Aviation Administration and lives in New Hampshire. Elizabeth is an architect and lives in San Francisco. Melissa has her own creative arts and crafts business and lives in Charlotte, North Carolina. Jaime got his PhD in physics from Stanford University, works at Lincoln Lab and lives in Arlington, Massachusetts. Arthur is also survived by 11 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gifts in Kerman’s name may be made to the Arthur Kerman Fellowship Fund, #3302540. Gifts will support fellowships in the Department of Physics, with a preference for fellows conducting research in theoretical physics.

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On May 19, MIT Human Resources held its annual Infinite Mile Award ceremony to acknowledge exceptional individuals and teams whose contributions help fulfill HR&#039;s core mission to advance a vibrant and diverse work community where individuals thrive and contribute to MIT&#039;s excellence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorraine A. Goffe, vice president for human resources, presented the awards to the 2017 HR Infinite Mile Award recipients in the categories of &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;nitiative and Customer Focus, Everyday Leadership, Collaboration and Community Building, and Innovating and Improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The award recipients are listed below, along with excerpts from their nominations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pauline Dowell&lt;/strong&gt;, for Initiative and Customer Focus: “Pauline is a problem solver, an emergency fixer, a go-to resource and colleague known for her ability to get things done. She is always willing to help with time-sensitive projects and always goes the extra mile in anticipating issues before they arise, taking care of her colleagues in HR and beyond.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raquel Irons, &lt;/strong&gt;for Initiative and Customer Focus: “Raquel is known for developing strong relationships with her clients to better understand their work, needs, and culture – which helps in building stronger departmental communities. All of her customers benefit from her grace and understanding and always kind manner.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People Matters Conference Core HR Team&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;Alyce Johnson&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Theresa Howell&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Maura Rizzuto)&lt;/strong&gt;, for Initiative and Customer Focus: “To say this first colleague owned this project would be an understatement — she lived and breathed it from inception to months afterward. She was a wizard at aligning people to projects that played to their strengths. Another colleague was the go-to person for a slew of responsibilities that are too numerous to mention. This colleague always remained calm under pressure and was a role model for other colleagues. The third colleague provided terrific support to the team, going above and beyond, to deliver a fantastic experience.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria Barrios, &lt;/strong&gt;for Everyday Leadership: “It started with a wonderful idea for the Excellence Awards — to provide translated nomination materials, so that non-native speakers could submit nominations, and the program could be more accessible to all MIT staff. Maria offered to translate outreach materials and nominations coming back to us. She made the translation process successful, but her interest always had to do with the success of the nominators and nominees, and in making an MIT program more open to everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HR Fun Committee&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;Dyan Madrey&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Cori Champagne&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Margie Ferreira&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Mae Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Kathy Kasabula&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Melissa Kavlakli&lt;/strong&gt;), for Collaboration and Community Building: “Since its inception at the beginning of this year, the team has played a prominent and vital role in building and strengthening our HR community. I am appreciative of this group’s efforts to generate positive energy and good feeling around the office. They are wonderfully creative, and have come up with a variety of events.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marlene Lewis, &lt;/strong&gt;for Innovating and Improving: “Her many years in private industry allowed her to come to HR and apply some of their experience (aka problem solving expertise) to create new and successful approaches, which greatly benefited the disabilities services team. She is innovative, efficient, energetic, a collaborator, committed, and customer-oriented.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scott Rolph,&lt;/strong&gt; for Innovating and Improving: “Scott’s efforts have required creative problem-solving, innovative thinking, risk-taking and navigating a diverse set of stakeholders. He developed and delivered a comprehensive training program for the customer service team at the new Atlas Center; re-vamped the content of a huge number of the training workshops, and created a Career Planning Guide that will be used to promote career development.”&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alissa Michelle Earle is rehearsing in front of her class. She stands before a presentation slide, and reads: “Mission Motivation: Apophis is coming!” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s not going to impact Earth but it’s going to come very close to us,” explains Earle, a graduate student in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apophis is&amp;nbsp;an asteroid the size of an aircraft carrier that will come within 5.5 Earth radii in 2029. As part of 16.83 (Space Systems Engineering), Earle is one of&amp;nbsp;20 students tasked with designing a space mission to measure the asteroid&#039;s&amp;nbsp;internal structure and potential long-term impact hazard.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor of planetary sciences Richard Binzel is leading 16.83 with David Miller, the Jerome C. Hunsaker Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics,&amp;nbsp;who recently returned to MIT after serving as chief technologist for NASA. Inspired by Apophis, the professors teamed up to issue MIT students a challenge: Build a major science robotics mission that marries planetary defense with scientific learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ingenuity of their MIT students soon blew Binzel and Miller away. Early on, the pair advised NASA colleagues of the project and invited their participation in a series of design reviews. As Miller notes, “Both Rick and I have a rolodex at NASA, and as the class progressed, the audience for our reviews grew bigger and bigger.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Binzel and Miller are helping students get ready for a major final review, which will be attended by NASA Headquarters officials and engineers from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). During the trial run, the students are well-prepared but nervous — fidgeting, speed talking, making edits. As Earle speaks, a woman in the audience of students and visiting faculty shouts: “There are a lot of scientific terms you’re using here that we’ve never heard before!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You don’t need to get into the specifics right at the beginning,” coaches Binzel, who is one of the world’s top scientists in the study of asteroids and Pluto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When MIT senior Diego Mundo, an aeronautical and astronautical engineering major, dives into spacecraft instrument design, Binzel interrupts: “Are you sure that will work?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am sure,” says Mundo, who&amp;nbsp;is dressed in a black t-shirt with&amp;nbsp;colored bracelets covering his arms and&amp;nbsp;hair flying out of a ponytail in all directions. But his expression is that of a stern academic as he allows that: “I may not have used the correct words.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s what today is for,” says Binzel. “You’re getting the feedback to make sure that everything is clear. Let’s go again.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space mission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The students want to get their performance and the science just right, since&amp;nbsp;asteroid flyby events&amp;nbsp;on the order of&amp;nbsp;Apophis happen only once about every 1,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The students&#039; general mission objectives include characterizing the asteroid’s shape, size, density, surface topography, surface composition, rotation rate, and spin state. A NASA spacecraft would have to be launched in August of 2026 to reach the observation position in time. The objective is to get the craft close&amp;nbsp;enough to Apophis&amp;nbsp;to conduct measurements before, during, and after the 2029 event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the student-designed mission is the first significant attempt to take on Apophis, which is 350 meters across with a mass of 20 million metric tons. At NASA, Miller says people tend to split into a couple of camps: those in space flight (or the “space cadets,” like him) and the scientists (like Binzel, whom he refers to as an&amp;nbsp;“asteroid hunter extraordinaire”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploration of the hazards posed by asteroids does not quite fit into either camp, Miller&amp;nbsp;says,&amp;nbsp;“so that kind of falls between the cracks at NASA.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project Apophis, as Binzel likes to say, is a “kick-starter” —&amp;nbsp;designed to encourage further studies by international space agencies. And for good reason, Miller adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There have been plenty of missions to comets and asteroids, so why is this unique?” he explains. “Apophis is coming so close that Earth’s gravity is going to tug and redirect its path. The Earth is going to give it a big thunk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome of that planetary&amp;nbsp;torque will teach scientists more about the construction of asteroids, which were some of the early building blocks of our own solar system. New information could lead to a deeper understanding of the formation of our solar system&amp;nbsp;and the more than 4,000 known planets around other stars. More pragmatically, what we learn from the Apophis encounter could strengthen our knowledge of&amp;nbsp;how to mount a planetary defense in the event an asteroid was ever discovered and verified to be on an impact course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the big day, the room is quiet, and the students are dressed up. Even Mundo appears&amp;nbsp;in a&amp;nbsp;button-up (albeit wrinkled) shirt, with his hair in a tidy bun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the listening experts are NASA Planetary Defense Officer&amp;nbsp;Lindley Johnson, who directs a program for detecting and tracking near-Earth objects; Paul Chodas, who heads the Center for Near-Earth Objects at JPL;&amp;nbsp;and Farah Alibay PhD &#039;14 a JPL systems engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practice sessions pay off. The students hit a rhythm, and take tough questions as smaller subteams, based on areas of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How well do you know the orbit of Apophis after the flyby event?” “Do you have the equipment to change your operation plans if there’s a change in the asteroid?” “Do you know what the rotation vector of the asteroid is?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teams don&#039;t necessarily have&amp;nbsp;all the answers: “Okay, we can look into that.” “We’ll do the analysis.” “Thanks for the input.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the experts are impressed.&amp;nbsp;“It’s a really good effort,”&amp;nbsp;NASA&#039;s Johnson says in an encouraging tone. “It’s almost ready for a NASA proposal.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Understanding anthropogenic effects on space weather</title>
    <link>http://news.mit.edu/2017/anthropogenic-effects-of-space-weather-0531</link>
    <description>New research from MIT Haystack Observatory reviews the ways in which human activity affects space weather around Earth. </description>
     <pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2017 18:10:01 -0400</pubDate>
 <dc:creator>Haystack Observatory</dc:creator>
 <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2017/anthropogenic-effects-of-space-weather-0531</guid>
<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Effects of human behavior are not limited to Earth&#039;s climate or atmosphere; they are also seen in the natural space weather surrounding our planet. &quot;Space weather&quot; in this context includes conditions in the space surrounding Earth, including the magnetosphere, ionosphere, and thermosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent survey by a team of scientists including Phil Erickson, assistant director of MIT Haystack Observatory, has resulted in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11214-017-0357-5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Space Science Reviews&lt;/em&gt;. The study provides a comprehensive review of anthropogenic, or human-caused, space weather impacts, including some recent findings using NASA&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/van-allen-probes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Van Allen Probes&lt;/a&gt; twin spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As space scientist James Van Allen discovered in the 1950s and 1960s, two radiation belts surround Earth with a slot&amp;nbsp;between them. The inner edge of the outer Van Allen radiation belt is particularly interesting, as it is composed of high-energy &quot;killer&quot; electrons that have the potential to permanently damage spacecraft. Tracking the inner edge of the radiation belt is important for GPS navigation, communication, and other satellite-based systems to help protect them from this naturally occurring radiation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, it was thought that the inner edge of the outer belt was under nearly all conditions located at the plasmapause, the outer boundary of cold, dense plasma surrounding Earth that is produced daily by the sun&#039;s extreme ultraviolet rays. During geomagnetic storms, extra energy from solar flares and coronal mass ejections interact with and compress the plasmasphere. Scientists originally thought that under these conditions, the inner edge of the outer Van Allen belt would contract with the compression of the plasmasphere and move closer to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research using the Van Allen Probes has discovered instead that during particularly intense geomagnetic storms, the inner edge of the outer belt does not follow suit but instead keeps its distance from the Earth, holding off the inner extent of &quot;killer electrons&quot; possessing damage potential. This inner limit to high-energy electrons occurs at the edge of strong human-origin radio transmissions created for a very different purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cms-placeholder-content-video&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong very low frequency (VLF) radio waves have been used for nearly a century to communicate with submarines, as they penetrate seawater well. But in addition to traveling through the ocean, the VLF waves also propagate upward along magnetic field lines and form a &quot;bubble&quot; of VLF transmissions, reaching to about the same spot that the ultra-relativistic electrons seem to stop during superstorms. The communications signals can interact with and remove some of these high-energy particles through loss to our atmosphere. This new understanding implies that human-origin systems can have an unexpected effect on high-energy space weather around our planet during these unusual, intense storms in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Space Science Reviews&lt;/em&gt; survey also explores a more direct effect caused by humans on the near-Earth space environment. High-altitude nuclear detonation tests during the Cold War also affected the near-Earth environment by creating long-lasting artificial radiation belts that disrupted power grids and satellite transmissions. Such tests are now banned: In particular, the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty — signed by all nuclear powers at the time — specifically prohibits nuclear weapons testing in the atmosphere. However, a large body of information on the effects of these atmospheric tests exists, and the article examines these historical nuclear explosions to further study of anthropogenic effects on space weather.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding human-origin space weather under these extreme conditions allows us to greatly enhance our knowledge of natural effects and allows essential engineering and scientific work aimed at protecting the planet&#039;s ground-based and satellite technology. “Nuclear atmospheric tests were a human-generated and extreme example of some of the space weather effects frequently caused by the sun,” says Erickson. “If we understand what happened in the somewhat controlled and definitely extreme conditions caused by one of these man-made events, and combine it with studies into longer term effects such as the VLF communications &#039;bubble,&#039; we can more readily advance our knowledge and prediction of natural variations in the near-space environment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work highlights the importance of continuing research into space weather — both naturally occurring effects and those influenced by human behavior — as an essential part of society&#039;s advance toward a more complex, spacefaring society.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LIDS Smart Urban Infrastructures Workshop highlights emerging research</title>
    <link>http://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-lids-smart-urban-infrastructures-workshop-highlights-emerging-research-0531</link>
    <description>Speakers from academia, industry, and government discuss the evolution of smart urban systems.</description>
     <pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2017 17:35:01 -0400</pubDate>

 <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-lids-smart-urban-infrastructures-workshop-highlights-emerging-research-0531</guid>
<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Data can reveal valuable insights about the ways humans interact with their urban surroundings, helping to determine the types of services and systems they need&amp;nbsp;and how those services and systems should work.&amp;nbsp;Transportation, the electric power grid, and other&amp;nbsp;services people rely upon&amp;nbsp;can become more automated and more responsive — and&amp;nbsp;ultimately&amp;nbsp;smarter — through data science approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Those ideas were at the center of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lidssmart2017.mit.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Smart Urban Infrastructures Workshop&lt;/a&gt;, which was held May 11-12 at the Media Lab. The event was&amp;nbsp;hosted by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lids.mit.edu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Laboratory for Information and Decisions Systems (LIDS)&lt;/a&gt;, which is both the longest-running research laboratory at MIT and the major research lab of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://idss.mit.edu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(IDSS).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Thanks to advances in technology, we see more and more smart services,” said Asuman Ozdaglar, the Joseph F. and Nancy P. Keithley Professor in Electrical Engineering and head of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. “These smart services take many forms and include increasingly more platforms for sharing resources.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The conference was organized around six central themes related to smart services: security and privacy;&amp;nbsp;smart cities and communities;&amp;nbsp;communications and the internet of things;&amp;nbsp;transportation services and platforms;&amp;nbsp;autonomous transportation; and smart grid and energy services. The first day included a &lt;a href=&quot;https://lidssmart2017.mit.edu/poster-session/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;student poster session&lt;/a&gt;, while the second day featured&amp;nbsp;a keynote talk from GE Digital Vice President Peter Marx, who also drew from some of his past experiences in the public sector as chief technology officer for the City of&amp;nbsp;Los Angeles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speakers on the&amp;nbsp;Security and Privacy in Smart Services panel shared a variety of perspectives on current privacy challenges. Daniel Weitzner, founding director of the MIT Internet Policy Research Initiative and principal research scientist at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), discussed the need to understand the significance and meaning of privacy in people’s lives in order to create effective policies. He explored&amp;nbsp;the complexity that emerges when people&amp;nbsp;try&amp;nbsp;to define exactly what privacy is in terms of how people perceive and value it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s tempting to have a single, formal definition of ‘privacy,” he said, “but we can’t do that. Privacy means different things to different people.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lalitha Sankar, assistant professor in the School of Electrical, Computer&amp;nbsp;and Energy Engineering at Arizona State University, addressed privacy and security in the context of power systems — including looking at the importance of cybersecurity in maintaining the operations of smart cities. She cited&amp;nbsp;the example of a major cyber attack that disabled a third of the Ukrainian power grid to illustrate a case in which “the control was bypassed from the human in the loop,” and where the cyber system itself was unable to identify the problem.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During the panel session on Smart Cities and Communities, Mark Gorenberg, the founder and managing director of Zetta Partners, talked about strategies for making communities more energy-efficient and more connected by using data related to local preferences and needs. Fellow panelist&amp;nbsp;Glenn Ricart of US Ignite emphasized the importance of “civic partnerships,” including work with volunteers and universities.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Amy Glasmeier, professor in the MIT Department of Urban Studies and Planning, focused on the ongoing challenge of providing more access to smart services for wider segments of the population.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“How do we change and broaden the demographics [of people using smart systems]?” Glasmeier asked. In designing smart systems, she said&amp;nbsp;the key question needs to be: “What is the problem we are trying to solve, and for whom?”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the panel on Communications and the Internet of Things in Smart Cities, Veniam CEO and founder João Barros&amp;nbsp;discussed some communications applications that can improve cities, such as having vehicles share software updates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Many applications allow you to reduce traffic if vehicles can communicate with each other,” he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Iyad Rahwan, a professor at the Media Lab and IDSS affiliate faculty member, presented some of his research on the complex ethical dilemmas of autonomous vehicles. Human drivers make quick, intuitive, and often high-stakes decisions to assess relative risk and act accordingly. Although efforts toward building these capabilities in cars are well underway, designing such complex systems presents great challenges, he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Smart Grid and Energy Services panel also highlighted the human component of smart systems. Marija Ilic, an IDSS&amp;nbsp;visiting professor, talked about the need to think about power grids as “data-enabled, socio-ecological systems.” Ilic and other panelists discussed the importance of making it easy for consumers to participate in decisions about energy usage — particularly by using data to identify certain tasks and decisions and then automate them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MIT Press teams with Internet Archive and Arcadia to provide access to hundreds of backlist titles</title>
    <link>http://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-press-teams-with-internet-archive-arcadia-to-digitize-hundreds-of-backlist-titles-0530</link>
    <description>Press&amp;#039; first major digitization endeavor ushers in a new era of access.</description>
     <pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2017 17:15:01 -0400</pubDate>
 <dc:creator>MIT Press</dc:creator>
 <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-press-teams-with-internet-archive-arcadia-to-digitize-hundreds-of-backlist-titles-0530</guid>
<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The MIT Press and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/index.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt; have announced a partnership,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with support from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arcadiafund.org.uk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Arcadia&lt;/a&gt;, to scan, preserve, and enable libraries to lend hundreds of MIT Press books that are currently not available digitally. This partnership represents an important advance in bringing acclaimed titles across the MIT Press’ publications in science, technology, art, and architecture to a global online audience. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The joint initiative is a crucial early step in Internet Archive’s ambitious plans to digitize and provide public access to 4 million books, by partnering widely with university presses and other publishers to source print works, and enable readers to borrow the digital versions from any library that owns the physical book, as well as from &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These books represent some of the finest scholarship ever produced, but right now online learners cannot unlock this knowledge,” says Brewster Kahle, founder and digital librarian of the Internet Archive. “Together with the MIT Press, we will enable the patrons of every library that owns these books to have a choice. They can read the physical book or the electronic version of these important texts.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet Archive is one of eight groups named semi-finalists in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macfound.org/programs/100change/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;100&amp;amp;Change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;a global competition for a single $100 million grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. The competition seeks bold solutions to critical problems of our time. The partnership with MIT Press is part of an ambitious plan to create more universal and equitable access to knowledge worldwide, bringing some of the most important books of the 20th century to scholars, journalists, students, and the print disabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT Press Director&amp;nbsp;Amy Brand says, “One of my top ambitions for the MIT Press since becoming director just two years ago has been to ensure that our entire legacy of publications is digitized, accessible, searchable, discoverable now and in perpetuity. Partnering with Internet Archive to achieve this objective is a dream come true not only for me and my colleagues at the press, but also for many of our authors whose earlier works are completely unavailable or not easily accessible.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lending online permits libraries to fulfill their mission in the digital age, allowing anyone in the world to borrow through the ether copies of works they own,” said Peter Baldwin, co-founder of Arcadia and professor of history at the University of California at Los Angeles. “The IA-MIT collaboration is a big step in the direction of realizing a universal library, accessible to anyone, anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MIT Press-Internet Archive partnership is the MIT Press’ first major digitization endeavor. It ushers in a new era of access for readers who value the press’ distinctive position as a university press that honors real world complexity by publishing interdisciplinary scholarship that crosses traditional boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An initial group of 1,500 MIT Press titles will be scanned at Internet Archive’s Boston Public Library facility, including Cyril Stanley Smith’s 1980 book, &quot;From Art to Science: Seventy-Two Objects Illustrating the Nature of Discovery,&quot; and Frederick Law Olmsted&amp;nbsp;and Theodora Kimball’s &quot;Forty Years of Landscape Architecture: Central Park,&quot; which was published in 1973.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;The oldest title in the group is Arthur C. Hardy’s 1936&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&quot;Handbook of Colorimetry.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Palfrey, head of school at Phillips Academy Andover and well-known public access advocate, described the partnership as “a truly ground-breaking development in open scholarship that I hope will inspire other university presses to follow suit, since so many excellent and important books are effectively out of circulation by virtue of being analog-only in a digital world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet Archive has already begun digitizing MIT Press’ backlist and anticipates lending copies as early as next month. The set of 1,500 deep backlist works should be available by the end of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On the 25th anniversary of the universal barcode in 1999, the barcode community gathered around Sanjay Sarma and his colleagues and said, “Let’s do this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our idea,” says Sarma, vice president for open learning and the Fred Fort Flowers (1941) and Daniel Fort Flowers (1941) Professor of Mechanical Engineering at MIT, “was to track everything in the supply chain.” Some companies knew they had too much inventory. Others didn’t know where their inventory was. Consumers couldn’t find the right sized shirt while that shirt was sitting in the back room. Food was going bad and shelves went un-stocked. Things got lost in the supply chain. So, Sarma, along with research scientist David Brock of MIT and Kevin Ashton, a visiting researcher from Proctor and Gamble, came up with a low-cost radio frequency identification (RFID) tag. “At the time, it was a crazy idea,” says Sarma. “But it stuck.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RFID tags, which had been around for several decades, were clunky and expensive — partly because of the amount of data placed on the tags. “We used to say, ‘Someday the internet will be everywhere’ — this was late 90s — and we didn’t have the word &#039;cloud&#039; yet. So, we used to say, ‘Someday, you can write the data in the sky,’” says Sarma, who developed new standards for RFID, new manufacturing processes, and innovative ways to use them in the supply chain. The supply chain industry adopted the protocol, and standards-making efforts shifted. &lt;a href=&quot;https://autoidlabs.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Auto ID Labs&lt;/a&gt; laid the groundwork for the standardization of RFID technology. It took sensing of identity — the job of RFID and barcodes — and made it universal. Auto ID Labs, where Sarma remains active today, emerged from the MIT Auto ID Center. “In many ways that effort also laid the groundwork for what is now called the internet of things,” Sarma says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internet of things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you look at the world today, you may have a Nest Thermostat in your home; you may have an Amazon Echo in your home; if you’re lucky enough to own a Tesla car, you can actually track your Tesla car over the internet. More appliances are becoming fundamentally internet-connected and intelligent in ways that make our lives safer, the world safer, help with climate change, help with saving costs, help with better health care,” says Sarma. All of this comes from a network of objects embedded in intelligence that interact with the environment. That is called the internet of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When we start connecting things,” says Sarma, “we enable a level of resource management, a level of marshalling of the planet, of what the planet offers us. When we have little or no information on something, we over-compensate. We burn more electricity, more energy and we’re doing more damage to the planet.” He asserts that hundreds of rooms are consuming electricity they should not, that are heating when no one is there. If you knew that a person was still driving and that there’s no need to turn the heat on, just imagine how much energy one could save and what impact this technology would have on the planet. “To me, saving the planet is sort of an existential question and we have an enormous amount of work to do to do that,” Sarma explains.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Risks, norms, and rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With any new technology, there are risks. The first and most fundamental one for the internet of things is privacy. “If I have a Nest Thermostat in my house, I can turn the heating off when I’m not at home. If I forget to turn off the heat when I go on vacation, it can detect that I’m away and turn itself off.” The flipside is that it can tell the wrong person you’re not there, thereby increasing the risk of theft and burglary. A sort of extreme version of that, he explains, is a malicious party claiming control of a nuclear power plant. This is the great fear of the internet of things: Many people are adopting it and they’re moving fast, but they’re not thinking about security, and that is a recipe for disaster. “My research deals with balancing the two,” Sarma says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any system with an agreed-upon architecture and with easy-to-understand methods, safeguards and security can be built into the system. “Imagine if you were concerned about safety on the roads — and we did have those worries a hundred years ago,” says Sarma. Over time, certain standards are implemented. “In the U.S. we drive on the right side of the road; we have traffic lights; we have stop signs; we have behavioral norms. If a parent and a child want to cross the street at a crosswalk, traffic stops. If a school bus in front of you flashes its lights, you stop. These behavioral norms — these standards — help recognize when something goes awry.” Sarma explains that if one of these behavioral norms is broken, one can deduce that the driver’s eyesight isn’t good, or that they weren’t paying attention, or maybe they were texting, or maybe that person is malicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with the internet of things is that within this newly established world, there are few norms. When different people implement it in their own way, it’s very hard to detect malice, he says. It’s also hard to put together a protection. Unlike the road systems, in which there are police cars and cameras, “we don’t have any of those. The internet of things is the wild west. My own research is directed toward establishing those norms and rules, so that at least you have some orderliness, so the remnant disorderliness stands out and can be detected.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avatar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One protection Sarma and his team are promoting is something called the avatar, a cloud-things concept. “The basic idea we’re saying is don’t have Object A talk to Object B, have Object A talk to its cloud avatar of itself. Have Object B talk to its Cloud Avatar of itself. Then, have the Avatars talk to each other.” The reason it works is because physical connections between A and B are many. “If you just say, the real object only talks to its avatar and the avatars talk to each other, we can bring to bear all the stuff we know from the WorldWideWeb, etc. That’s a clean way to look at the future of the internet of things and, strangely enough, that’s what Tesla does, that’s what Nest does, but unfortunately implementations are a little bit all over the place,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The internet of things will go through its ups and downs, but when we look back on our lives in 10 years, pretty much anything you do you’ll back on a day when it wasn’t connected and you’ll sort of wonder how life was then.”&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT Video Productions (MVP), formerly known as Academic Media Production Services (AMPS), received its second New England Emmy Award nomination for its documentary, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mvp.mit.edu/video/mit2016-documentary-series-episode-one-a-bold-move/&quot;&gt;A Bold Move&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&quot;&lt;/em&gt; in the education/schools category. In 2014, MVP was nominated and &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2014/amps-wins-new-england-emmy-award-awakening&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;won the award&lt;/a&gt; for its work in the category of arts and entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first in a four-part series of documentaries produced in celebration of MIT’s 100th year in Cambridge, Massachusetts, &quot;A Bold Move&lt;em&gt;&quot; &lt;/em&gt;tells the story of the visionaries, led by the newly appointed President Richard Cockburn Maclaurin, who spearheaded the Institute’s relocation from Boston to Cambridge in 1916. The 17-minute film details the challenges and aspirations of the era, and explores the innovative design of MIT’s vast set of interconnected buildings known as the Main Group, which would have an enormous impact on science, technology, and education in the years that followed. Referred to as the “mega building,” it was the first MIT structure architected to foster cross-disciplinary research and education, which remains one of the Institute’s hallmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&#039;A Bold Move&#039; is emblematic of the many spectacular stories to be told about MIT’s history, from its well-known excellence in research and engineering to its lesser-known, but equally bright, distinction in the humanities, arts, and social sciences,” said Larry Gallagher, executive producer and senior director of MIT Video Productions. “At MVP, we are honored to shine a light on the Institute’s many areas of excellence with work that reflects the overall richness of the MIT experience.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cms-placeholder-content-video&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying narrative of &quot;A Bold Move&quot; is about far more more than constructing a new campus; it’s about a broad vision and what it symbolized. “MIT isn’t just building a new set of buildings to accommodate its space constraints, it’s building a new set of buildings to make a statement to the world about the importance of science and technology education,” says Deborah Douglas, curator of science and technology at the MIT Museum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;A Bold Move&quot; and the other documentaries in the series feature a variety of MIT faculty, students, and staff as well as members of the Cambridge community, including city officials and historians. Nearly every member of the MVP team contributed to the production of the film, led by producer/director Joe McMaster and editor/co-producer Jean Dunoyer ’87. Prior to joining the MVP team, McMaster and Dunoyer honed their storytelling skills making documentaries for PBS and National Geographic, among others. The production of MVP’s Emmy Award-nominated program was supported in part by a generous gift from Jane and Neil Pappalardo ’64.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winner of the education/schools award will be announced June 24 at the 40th Annual New England Emmy Awards in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://massbreastfeeding.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Massachusetts Breastfeeding Coalition (MBC)&lt;/a&gt; has recognized MIT as a breastfeeding-friendly employer for its active support&amp;nbsp;of employees who want to continue breastfeeding when they return to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several working mothers at MIT nominated the Institute for the MBC award.&amp;nbsp;Nominators were asked to provide information on the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;availability of a&amp;nbsp;private space for employees to pump or express breast milk or nurse their babies;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;flexibility for employees to bring young babies to work with them;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;regular break times or a more flexible work schedule to facilitate pumping and nursing;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;access to an electric breast pump;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;a refrigerator for storage of expressed breast milk, and sink area for cleaning equipment; and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;information on workplace breastfeeding support services for&amp;nbsp;all employees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In awarding the designation, MBC lauded MIT for having&amp;nbsp;a “great support system.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT will be recognized for its&amp;nbsp;achievement at MBC&#039;s&amp;nbsp;Breastfeeding in the Bay State 2017&amp;nbsp;conference in September.&lt;/p&gt;
