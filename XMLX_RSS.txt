<p>Season seven draws near and the cast and crew are speaking up at an increasing rate. This time it was <em>Westworld</em>, <em>Ray Donovan</em> and <em>Game of Thrones</em> director of photography Robert McLachlan, who spoke to <em>Deadline</em> about the how the <em>Game of Thrones</em> job compares to <em>Westworld</em>, and hyped up this year&#8217;s &#8220;showstopping, epic&#8221; season.</p>
<p><span id="more-145071"></span>As well as working on <em>Westworld</em>, which is the focus of the <a href="http://deadline.com/2017/06/game-of-thrones-westworld-robert-mclachlan-cinematography-emmys-interview-news-1202102613/"><em>Deadline</em> interview</a>, McLachlan was the DP for some vital <em>Game of Thrones</em> episodes: <em>The Rains of Castamere</em>, <em>Mhysa</em>, <em>Oathkeeper</em>, <em>First of His Name</em>, <em>The Dance of Dragons</em>, and <em>Mother&#8217;s Mercy</em>. After taking season six off, McLachlan returned this year for the fourth and fifth episodes.</p>
<p>When asked about his inspirations for <em>Westworld</em>, McLachlan went on a <em>Game of Thrones</em> tangent regarding the benefits of working in a European-centric production:</p>
<p>&#8220;My primary visual references are fine art. One of the things I love about working on <em>Game of Thrones</em> is that you can hop on a plane and go to the Louvre, and go to the Prado, and go to the Rijksmuseum in Holland. That&#8217;s what I do, and I spend a lot of time in there, looking at the masters, really, and aiming for a more painterly look.&#8221;</p>
<p>Creatively, there are some disadvantages to working in <em>Game of Thrones</em>, however: </p>
<p>&#8220;With the huge vis effects component, everything is storyboarded for the bigger sequences ahead of time, and quite frankly, on the day, it takes a lot of the creativity out of lighting on the set. We had some storyboards for <em>Westworld</em>, for a couple sequences, but mostly we didn&#8217;t, and we almost never do for <em>Ray Donovan</em>, for instance.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-2017-05-25-15.12.49.png"><img src="http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-2017-05-25-15.12.49.png" alt="Screenshot 2017-05-25 15.12.49" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-145105" srcset="http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-2017-05-25-15.12.49.png 1920w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-2017-05-25-15.12.49-300x169.png 300w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-2017-05-25-15.12.49-768x432.png 768w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-2017-05-25-15.12.49-1024x576.png 1024w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-2017-05-25-15.12.49-800x450.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a></p>
<p>Though McLachlan finds the meticulously pre-planned nature of this show constraining, he is manifestly excited about season seven, and isn&#8217;t hesitant to hype up what&#8217;s coming:</p>
<p>&#8220;I wrapped up just before Christmas, and then they did some CG component work and some green screen work in the new year&#8230; Season 7 is going to be fantastic. We did a showstopping, pretty epic scene in Europe just before I came back, and it&#8217;s really going to be great. I don&#8217;t know the facts and figures, but they only did seven episodes this year, but I think their budget&#8217;s probably the same, so I think you&#8217;re going to see — whereas before, we&#8217;d have one or two showstopping, major episodes per season, this season, probably at least half of them are whoppers. They’re not going to disappoint.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the good side to the shortened season, isn&#8217;t it? Whether the budget increased or remained at season six levels, more time and money was allocated to each individual episode, allowing for grander action sequences and greater cinematography in general.</p>

<p><em>Game of Thrones</em> has suffered greatly from leaks during this season&#8217;s production, perhaps more than ever before —or maybe it only feels that way because we don&#8217;t have books to compare to anymore, so anything we gather from filming, casting or script leaks constitutes a spoiler in a way it never did before. In any case, for those of us who have followed the news closely it may appear as if there are no season seven surprises left anymore&#8230; But we were wrong! <strong>Beware: spoilers below the cut!</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-145027"></span>During a set visit last October,  <a href="http://www.torontosun.com/2017/06/02/game-of-thrones-season-7-secrets-from-the-set-of-hbos-fantasy-epic"><em>Toronto Sun</em></a> got to learn quite a bit about the production. In fact, if you want to go on a tour of the sets and costumes at Belfast&#8217;s Titanic Studios and the Banbridge soundstage, go ahead and read <em>Steve Tilley</em>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.torontosun.com/2017/06/02/game-of-thrones-season-7-secrets-from-the-set-of-hbos-fantasy-epic">report of his set visit</a>. But sets and costumes aren&#8217;t the only thing he saw. In fact, Tilley sets the stage for two political scenes early in the season (dialogue included!), and for another kind of scene that may confuse and excite you in equal measure —at least, that was my reaction.</p>
<p><em>Toronto Sun</em> details a scene for <strong>episode two</strong> with the entire Targaryen faction. If you followed the production closely, you may have feared as I did that we were never going to get to see all of Dany&#8217;s loyalists together in a room&#8230; and I&#8217;m quite happy to be wrong about that: around <strong>Dragonstone</strong>&#8216;s famous map table room, discussing &#8220;the best way to pry King’s Landing from Cersei Lannister’s grip,&#8221; there were <strong>Daenerys Targaryen</strong>, <strong>Tyrion Lannister</strong>, <strong>Missandei</strong>, <strong>Theon</strong> and <strong>Yara Greyjoy</strong>, <strong>Ellaria Sand</strong> and <strong>Olenna Tyrell</strong>.</p>
<div id="attachment_137304" style="width: 2110px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GoT-Sn7_FirstLook_11.jpg"><img src="http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GoT-Sn7_FirstLook_11.jpg" alt="Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) in front of her new throne / Photo: Helen Sloan/HBO" width="2100" height="1398" class="size-full wp-image-137304" srcset="http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GoT-Sn7_FirstLook_11.jpg 2100w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GoT-Sn7_FirstLook_11-300x200.jpg 300w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GoT-Sn7_FirstLook_11-768x511.jpg 768w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GoT-Sn7_FirstLook_11-1024x682.jpg 1024w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GoT-Sn7_FirstLook_11-800x533.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 2100px) 100vw, 2100px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) in front of her new throne / Photo: Helen Sloan/HBO</p></div>
<p>The newspaper was privy to another scene of a similar political nature, though this one was from the premiere, and set not in the ancient Targaryen stronghold but up north in <strong>Winterfell</strong>. Present in the banquet hall where Jon Snow was proclaimed king in the North there was, of course, the king himself, <strong>Jon Snow</strong>, as well as <strong>Sansa Stark</strong>, <strong>Brienne of Tarth</strong>, <strong>Davos Seaworth</strong>, <strong>Lyanna Mormont</strong>, and <strong>Tormund Giantsbane</strong> —the king, his noble sister and her protector, his foremost adviser, a precocious bannerwoman, and a representative of the Free Folk. In the scene, they discuss the imminent threat of the White Walkers and what to do about it. Jon Snow insists they need to start mining obsidian, the only material known to kill White Walkers besides Valyrian steel: &#8220;Dragonglass kills White Walkers, and it&#8217;s now more valuable than gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the third scene, Tilley wasn&#8217;t a direct witness, yet it may be the most intriguing of them all. Instead of seeing a scene being performed, he saw a prop being sculpted. How is that intriguing or exciting in any way? Well, it was a <strong>massive dragon skull</strong>&#8230; one out of <strong>40 differently-sized dragon skulls</strong>. How does a dragon graveyard fit into season seven? Is it the dragonpit, perhaps? Or the dragon skulls under the Red Keep? We have no idea, but the <em>Toronto Sun</em> was told all of them had to be sculpted physically (instead of digitally) because there would be people running around (and perhaps on) the skulls.</p>
<p>So there it is: that Winterfell scene description tells us nothing new, but it does include dialogue straight out of the show; the Dragonstone scene assures us we&#8217;ll get to see all of the Targaryen loyalists interact before they split up during the campaign; and this apparent dragon graveyard&#8230; is just a great mystery. Isn&#8217;t it curious we haven&#8217;t heard absolutely nothing about this before? Season seven still holds some surprises!</p>

<p>When HBO announced four Game of Thrones spin-offs were being developed, we all went mad with our speculation. George R.R. Martin later crossed <a href="http://watchersonthewall.com/george-rr-martin-dishes-game-thrones-spin-offs-eliminates-2-possibilities/">a few possibilities</a> off our list, and confirmed all were prequels. There were, however, a few questions still: is the plan to produce them all? Merely the ones deemed good enough? Or is it a talent war with only one winner in mind? And what is the timetable for any of this, anyway?</p>
<p>Now we have the answers, but they may not be the ones you were hoping for, especially in regards to the <strong>likely late premiere of this prequel&#8230; and of season 8, too!</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-144967"></span>In an interview with <em><a href="http://ew.com/tv/2017/06/02/game-of-thrones-prequel-final-season-interview/">EW</a></em>, HBO programming president Casey Bloys was quite frank about the early stages of development in which these spin-offs actually are:</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to put the prequels in context. It should go without saying I love having a show with this much intense interest around it. Even the smallest bit of information is a big deal and I appreciate that. But I wanted to make sure fans know this is a really embryonic process. I haven’t even seen outlines.&#8221; In other words: calm down. </p>
<p>Also, we should probably temper our expectations in terms of quantity: &#8220;In the press at large, everybody said, &#8216;there are four spinoffs&#8217; and they assume that means each one is happening and we&#8217;re going to have a new Game of Thrones show per quarter. That&#8217;s not what&#8217;s going on,&#8221; Bloys clarified. &#8220;The idea is not to do four shows. The bar set by [David Benioff and D.B. Weiss] is so high that my hope is to get one show that lives up to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why develop multiple projects at once then, if most of them will not see the light of day? Apparently, this is as unusual as it sounds, and <em>Game of Thrones</em> is unique in this respect: &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t do this with a lot of shows. In talking with the drama group here, and the nice thing is George has created an entire universe &#8230; The other reason, frankly, as I said, is the bar is so high. If you only developed one, everything would rest on that one shot &#8230; I want to make sure that [any prequel] feels worthy. We have some amazing writers who want to take a shot at this. They&#8217;re also looking at different times in the universe and all will have different feels. This increases our odds of finding one that’s unique.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_144878" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2-1.jpg"><img src="http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2-1.jpg" alt="Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark in Season 7.

<p>To learn about D&#038;D&#8217;s involvement or the possibility of an anthology, <a href="http://ew.com/tv/2017/06/02/game-of-thrones-prequel-final-season-interview/">read the interview</a>. They key points are that it&#8217;s going to be a <strong>single prequel</strong>, and it&#8217;s going to <strong>take its time</strong> being developed, as it should. They have other priorities in mind right now: &#8220;Our No. 1 goal is the seventh season this summer and getting the eighth season written and aired.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The show has proven that TV is every bit as impressive and in many cases moreso than film. What they’re doing is monumental. When you see these battles in season 7, and what I imagine season 8 will be, it&#8217;s a big, big show. We&#8217;ve done a lot of great shows, but this one combines the complex characters we love with a huge cinematic scope. I think this is the first show to prove that can be done — and we&#8217;re the first people to pay for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no doubt about Bloys&#8217; pride concerning season seven: &#8220;I don’t want to oversell, but I can’t imagine anybody being disappointed in this season. It’s amazing.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for that last season, here it is when the news perhaps take a sour turn. <em>EW</em>&#8216;s Hibberd and Bloys more than imply that <strong>season eight may take longer to arrive than expected.</strong> When the season seven filming schedule was delayed to film during winter, the assumption was next season would follow a similar path, which would mean waiting for less than a year this time around. Sadly, that may not be the case: Hibberd claims the showrunners told him they&#8217;re working on season eight &#8220;for the next year and and a half,&#8221; which by his calculation could mean &#8220;the final season could air in 2018 and/or in 2019.&#8221; Bloys doesn&#8217;t specifically confirm the claim, but he certainly doesn&#8217;t deny it either: </p>
<p>&#8220;They have to write the episodes and figure out the production schedule. We’ll have a better sense of that once they get further into the writing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Could it really be we&#8217;ll have to wait until 2019 for the resolution to <em>Game of Thrones</em>? This is by no means a confirmation —HBO doesn&#8217;t even seem sure about the timetable here. But if Hibberd is correct about what the showrunners told him, this winter in Westeros promises to be a long one. Hopefully we&#8217;ll not freeze to death as we wait.</p>

<p>The connection between<em> Game of Thrones</em> and real-world history is frequently brought up in discussion among fans, critics and scholars. Now, the folks at Harvard University will explore that connection further with a new course entitled &#8220;The Real Game of Thrones: From Modern Myths to Medieval Models.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://time.com/4798917/harvard-game-of-thrones-class/"><em>Time</em> magazine</a> has the scoop, with an exclusive look at the introductory-level course taught by Sean Gilsdorf, in tandem with assistant professor Racha Kirakosian.</p>
<p><span id="more-144958"></span>The course will include material from both <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> novels and the TV series. The course description, according to <em>Time</em>, states they&#8217;ll examine the way the books and <em>Game of Thrones</em> &#8220;echoes and adapts, as well as distorts the history and culture of the &#8216;medieval world&#8217; of Eurasia from c. 400 to 1500 CE&#8221; by studying &#8220;a set of archetypal characters at the heart of <em>Game of Thrones</em> — the king, the good wife, the second son, the adventurer, and so on — with distinct analogues in medieval history, literature, religion, and legend.&#8221;</p>
<p>Professor Gilsdorf tells <em>Time </em>that &#8220;medieval biographies of queens will be prime source material.&#8221; Kirakosian tells the magazine that the course will be a &#8220;&#8216;recruitment tool&#8217; for the medieval studies and humanities courses, in general.&#8221;</p>

<p>As an avid wine lover and obsessive <em>Game of Thrones</em> fan, no one was more excited than I was at the <a href="http://watchersonthewall.com/vintage-wine-estates-hbo-debut-game-thrones-wines-month/">announcement</a> back in March that two of my favorite things were coming together. <a href="http://www.vintagewineestates.com/our-brands/game-of-thrones-wines">Vintage Wine Estates</a> and renowned winemaker Bob Cabral have crafted three options to suit a variety of tastes: a Chardonnay, a Red Blend, and a Cabernet Sauvignon. Each one is a complex and unique blend of flavors worthy of the finest castles in the Seven Kingdoms.</p>
<p><span id="more-144838"></span>I was fortunate enough to sample all three over the weekend, and they did not disappoint. The bottles alone make the purchase worthwhile; the beautiful golden labels feature a tableau of animals representing the great houses of Westeros. Each cork is adorned with either the Lannister lion, the Stark direwolf, or the Targaryen three-headed dragon.<a href="http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Game-of-Thrones-Chardonnay.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-144840" src="http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Game-of-Thrones-Chardonnay-217x300.jpg" alt="Game of Thrones Chardonnay" width="217" height="300" srcset="http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Game-of-Thrones-Chardonnay-217x300.jpg 217w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Game-of-Thrones-Chardonnay-768x1060.jpg 768w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Game-of-Thrones-Chardonnay-742x1024.jpg 742w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Game-of-Thrones-Chardonnay-300x414.jpg 300w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Game-of-Thrones-Chardonnay-800x1104.jpg 800w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Game-of-Thrones-Chardonnay.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 217px) 100vw, 217px" /></a></p>
<p>First up was the Chardonnay, hailing from California’s Central Coast. Consisting of 90% Chardonnay and 10% Riesling, it has a lighter, crisper taste than your average Chardonnay. The wine is a beautiful light golden color, with a fruity floral aroma.</p>
<p>The predominant flavor is Meyer lemon, closely followed by a mixture of honey and spices. Like most Chardonnays, it has a buttery, slightly oaky finish. It’s a perfect wine for the hot, humid days of summer – not too sweet, not too heavy, but a refreshing blend of flavors that could rival the finest Arbor Gold.</p>
<p><a href="http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Game-of-Thrones-Red-Blend.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-144843" src="http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Game-of-Thrones-Red-Blend-195x300.jpg" alt="Game of Thrones Red Blend" width="195" height="300" srcset="http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Game-of-Thrones-Red-Blend-195x300.jpg 195w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Game-of-Thrones-Red-Blend-768x1181.jpg 768w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Game-of-Thrones-Red-Blend-666x1024.jpg 666w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Game-of-Thrones-Red-Blend-300x461.jpg 300w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Game-of-Thrones-Red-Blend-800x1230.jpg 800w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Game-of-Thrones-Red-Blend.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 195px) 100vw, 195px" /></a></p>
<p>The Red Blend was next. This wine is blend of eight varietals – predominantly Syrah, Tempranillo and Petite Sirah – from the Paso Robles region. Its rich, ruby color with aromas of black cherry, blackberry, and cocoa promise a rewarding taste, and it certainly delivers.</p>
<p>It hits your tongue with a tart fruitiness that quickly gives way to spice and leather. A hint of vanilla on the finish rounds out its multifaceted flavor profile. It’s an excellent choice for those who prefer a dry red that’s complex enough to pair with a hearty feast, yet light enough to enjoy on its own. Be wary of overindulging unless you’re Tyrion Lannister, however – at 14.7% ABV, it’s the most potent of the bunch.</p>
<p><a href="http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Game-of-Thrones-Cabernet-Sauvignon.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-144844" src="http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Game-of-Thrones-Cabernet-Sauvignon-188x300.jpg" alt="Game of Thrones Cabernet Sauvignon" width="188" height="300" srcset="http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Game-of-Thrones-Cabernet-Sauvignon-188x300.jpg 188w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Game-of-Thrones-Cabernet-Sauvignon-768x1223.jpg 768w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Game-of-Thrones-Cabernet-Sauvignon-643x1024.jpg 643w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Game-of-Thrones-Cabernet-Sauvignon-300x478.jpg 300w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Game-of-Thrones-Cabernet-Sauvignon-800x1274.jpg 800w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Game-of-Thrones-Cabernet-Sauvignon.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 188px) 100vw, 188px" /></a></p>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, was the Cabernet Sauvignon. The most expensive at nearly $50 per bottle, I had high expectations for this Napa Valley wine. The description promises “a wine worthy of the Iron Throne” and &#8211; rest assured &#8211; that’s what you get.</p>
<p>Deep purple in color, with a nose of black currant and vanilla, it looks and smells as glorious as it tastes. A dark fruit flavor and smooth, velvety texture combine with a dry finish, leaving you with a hint of cocoa. This is a robust and slightly heavy wine, perfect for days that promise winter is coming. I don’t normally drink Cabernet in warm weather, but for this one I would make an exception. It’s that good.</p>
<p>My verdict: the <em>Game of Thrones</em> wines are as intriguing as the drama for which they are named, but much less likely to break your heart. When you play this game of wine, you most certainly win.</p>
<p>The wines are available <a href="http://www.gameofthroneswines.com/">online</a> and in stores now; prices range from $19.99 for the Chardonnay and the Red Blend up to $49.99 for the Cabernet Sauvignon. Check the <a href="http://www.gameofthroneswines.com/retail-locations">website</a> for locations near you.</p>

<p>When the seventh season of <em>Game of Thrones</em> was announced to be three episodes shorter than that to which we are accustomed, there was worry, excitement and many questions, such as: would this affect the average episode&#8217;s running time in any way? Recently, we did learn the <a href="http://watchersonthewall.com/game-thrones-season-7-premiere-episode-longest-years/">season premiere</a> would be the longest first episode in years, but the question remained — what&#8217;s the deal with the season overall? At last, we know! As for the season finale, they are usually quite long&#8230; and this will be no exception!</p>
<p><span id="more-144921"></span><a href="http://ew.com/tv/2017/05/30/game-of-thrones-remaining-episodes-length/?xid=email-email-gameofthrones-20170530PM-tout1"><em>EW</em></a> reported on this very issue, giving the season premiere 58 minutes — which is what the HBO site originally claimed, before <a href="http://www.hbo.com/search?type=schedule&#038;focusId=799557">changing it to 59</a>. I guess we&#8217;ll have to wait and see the truth. In any event, a minute here or there makes little difference, and <em>EW</em> has been able to confirm <strong>the average episode will not be significantly longer</strong> than usual. And the reason for that aligns with <a href="http://watchersonthewall.com/game-thrones-season-7-premiere-episode-longest-years">our speculation</a>: the showrunners chose seven episodes (and six for the last season) because that&#8217;s what the story needed, and it allows them to devote more time and money on each episode. Hibberd raises another point: instead of making longer episodes, they would have just made <em>more</em> of them, not only because to do otherwise would defeat the point of making fewer episodes but because it would make little financial sense, as the cast and crew are largely paid per episode.</p>
<p>The <em>EW</em> article buries the lede a little bit, however: while it is true the average running time will not differ greatly from previous years, it is now confirmed the last episode will be one of the big ones: <strong>the season finale will run &#8220;well over an hour.&#8221;</strong> So far, the average finale is 62 minutes long, though the petite 52 minutes season one finale weighs down the average considerably. The four longest episodes ever are finales, including last year&#8217;s <em>&#8220;The Winds of Winter&#8221;</em>, at almost 68 minutes — the show&#8217;s record running time.</p>
<p>So, even at &#8220;well over an hour&#8221;, the season seven finale has some stiff competition. It&#8217;s now clear the episodes this year will follow essentially the same format as always, so if you were looking forward to super-sized episodes, you will be largely disappointed — the season finale is your only hope in that respect. If &#8220;well over an hour&#8221; means &#8220;more than 8 extra minutes,&#8221; it could still be the longest episode in <em>Game of Thrones</em> history.</p>

The Stark children have grown a lot over the past 6 seasons, some for the better, others &#8230; perhaps less so. Entertainment Weekly asked Kit Harington, Sophie Turner, Maisie William and Isaac Hempstead-Wright which Stark child Ned would be proudest of. Interestingly, nobody named any of Ned&#8217;s sons.</p>
<p><span id="more-144857"></span></p>
<p><iframe src="//players.brightcove.net/219646971/default_default/index.html?videoId=5453065573001" width="700" height="455" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Kit Harington gave his vote to Arya but said that he doesn&#8217;t think Ned would be the sort of father to play favorites, a sentiment echoed by Isaac Hempstead-Wright.</p>
<p>Sophie Turner also chose Arya, &#8220;Just because he was always very, very supportive of her doing what she wanted and going against the grain and kind of being kind of being an independent young girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a <del>predictable</del> twist, Maisie Williams named Sansa for being the Stark child who&#8217;s developed the most since season 1. Turner then conceded that, yeah, Sansa&#8217;s her honest pick as well.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='700' height='424' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/thjQM7SBHDE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>In other news, Nikolaj Coster Waldau gave an interview at Argentina Comic Con in which he painted a vivid picture of Jaime Lannister&#8217;s perfect death scene: dying of old age whilst professing his eternal love for Brienne  &#8230; though he also thinks expiration by dragon fire would be thematically fitting as well.</p>
<p>He also discussed his character&#8217;s ambiguous sense of morality, admitting that he never saw Jaime as a villain, even in his early days. He likened the character-defining decision to push Bran out of the window to refusing to allow a stranger&#8217;s child onto lifeboat that&#8217;s already filled to capacity by one&#8217;s own offspring. &#8220;There&#8217;s another option of course &#8230; you could just sacrifice yourself,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Good talk, Nikolaj.</p>

<p>New stills from season 7 have been released, offering a closer look at where we&#8217;ll find Arya, Daenerys and Sansa come this July.</p>
<p><span id="more-144867"></span>An article in the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-ca-st-summer-preview-previously-on-game-of-thrones-20170528-story.html">Los Angeles Times</a> analyzing the increasingly prominent and empowering role women are playing in <em>Game of Thrones</em> included a gallery that featured three new stills from the upcoming season.</p>
<p>The most interesting of the three features Sansa, presumably Winterfell, sporting the long-sleeves-and-chains style of dress that appears to be all the rage in season 7, albeit with some distantly Stark adornment.</p>
<p><a href="http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2-1.jpg"><img src="http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2-1.jpg" alt="2" width="2048" height="1363" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-144878" srcset="http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2-1.jpg 2048w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2-1-300x200.jpg 300w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2-1-768x511.jpg 768w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2-1-800x532.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></a></p>

Some are shocking (Catelyn, Robb), some are tragic (Shireen, Hodor), and some are downright satisfying (Joffrey, Ramsay). The show has been even more bloodthirsty than the books as far as killing major characters is concerned – so much so that “valar morghulis” should be the official motto.</p>
<p><span id="more-144849"></span>While the most iconic deaths have been officially memorialized in the “<a href="http://beautifuldeath.com/">Beautiful Death</a>” series, fan artists have their own unique interpretations. Artist <strong>Hannes Sommer </strong>(HansoArt) posted a <a href="https://youtu.be/rJptguZvY0I">video</a> yesterday featuring his take on 35 of the major character deaths in Game of Thrones to date. Featuring hand drawn images and some fun interaction, Sommer states in the description that the project took around 150 hours to complete. That&#8217;s dedication!</p>
